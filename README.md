# Welcome to the repository

Put all your code here. A few notes:
 - I told github to ignore the data folder, so add your own data files to the folder yourselves.
 - Results go in the results folder

To make code run consistently we all need the same names for the data files. I'll keep a list of filenames here:
 - covid_de.csv: the raw covid data from Kaggle
